The Azure Marketplace is like your app store for the cloud. It contains 1000's of pre-configured solutions to help you get going. To learn more about the Azure Marketplace check out [this overview post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/cdndevs/2016/03/08/what-is-the-azure-marketplace/).

As an early stage tech startup you might be elligable for [BizSpark](https://www.microsoft.com/bizspark) which can provide up to $120,000 in free Azure credits. These credits can be applied to the VMs deployed from the Marketplace. Though if the publisher charges any costs above the base compute cost, you will have to pay for this directly, credits cannot be used in that case. The good news is many solutions in the Marketplace are free!
